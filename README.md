This project is created by Michael Johnson, for the purpose of studying and understanding the basics of the React framework, powered by the Scrimba community.
The course begins with a structured understanding of creating and rendering React applications, creating and exporting custom components and also revisiting some basic styling tools using CSS and HTML layout techniques. The course is capped with a solo project with the goal to build a personalised digital business card.
