This project is created by Michael Johnson, for the purpose of studying and understanding the basics of the React framework, powered by the Scrimba community.

1. The course begins with the fundamentals and structured understanding of creating and rendering React applications, creating and exporting custom components and also does justice by revisiting some basic styling tools using CSS and HTML layout techniques. The module is capped with a solo project with the goal to build a personalised digital business card.

2. The second module is mainly focused on using props and the `.map()` method in React to render data into custom components. Props, in a sense are similar to native HTML attributes that gives are custom components more functionality to render dynamic data, making it composable. This style of rendering data is prevalent across the web apps and sites such as Youtube, Airbnb and a few others. The solo project after the module was designed to test your ability to create multiple elements using our knowledge on props. Happy coding.
